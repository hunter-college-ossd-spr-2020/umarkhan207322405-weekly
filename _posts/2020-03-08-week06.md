### Project Activities
I have finished my research on the project **Inkscape**. I went to the website thinking it would have a user friendly environment and an easy way for regular users to install inkscape. It was quite easy for me to install it since I was using Mac. It is quite compatible with Windows as well as Ubuntu. Installation was quite easy directly from the website. Curiosity got the best pf me so I decided to uninstall the current version and install it manually. It was quite easy and the instructions on [running it](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape-web) were quite easy as well. There documentation was on point and any user would have been able to understand what the commands are for since they explain what commands they are using and why.I have also looked at the [issues](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape-web/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=closed) and found out that maintainers are quite friendly and they respond to issues very nicely. They also try to resolve issues as soon as they can. The only issue that I have right now is getting used to gitlab since we have been using github since th estart of the semester. Even though it is quite similar to github, there are some features that I am unfamiliar with like security and compliance.

### Contributions
This week I made a contribution to OpenStreet Map and edited the Contributions.md file accordingly.
