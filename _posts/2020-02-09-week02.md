This week we talked about many different things related to Git as well as Linux and for the assignemnt, we have to read Pro Git book and I have read Getting started and the basics of Git and now I can tell why developers even use Github. Fisrt of all, if it keeps a log for all commits and changes made to a repository. Then, if a file has been deleted,a previous version of that file can be recovered since it makes backups and finally that multpile people can simultaneously edit a file using version control. I learned a couple of important things from the book and hope to learn new features every week
