This week we talked about many different things related to Git, as well as Linux and for the assignment. We have to read **Pro Git** book and I have read Getting started and the basics of Git, and now I can tell why developers even use Github. First of all, it keeps a log for all commits and changes made to a repository. Then, if a file has been deleted, a previous version of that file can be recovered since it makes backups and finally,  multiple people can simultaneously edit a file using version control. I learned a couple of important things from the book and hope to learn new features every week.
